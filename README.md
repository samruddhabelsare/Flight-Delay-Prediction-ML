# Flight-Delay-Prediction-ML
Machine Learning models to predict flight delays using US domestic flight data (2024). Compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers with detailed visualizations and class imbalance handling.

This project tackles the challenge of predicting flight delays using a large real-world US domestic flights dataset (2024). The notebook demonstrates the full data science pipeline, including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and target creation
- Handling class imbalance in the target variable
- Training and evaluating four different machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
- Visualizing results with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and comparative metric bar plots
- Comparing model performance based on accuracy, recall, F1, and AUC scores

The results provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, with a focus on practical considerations for forecasting rare but impactful flight delays.
